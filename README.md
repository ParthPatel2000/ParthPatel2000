# 👋 Hi, I’m Parth Patel (@ParthPatel2000)

I build **full-stack automation tools, Chrome extensions, and system enhancements** that streamline workflows and make complex tasks effortless.  
My specialty is modernizing **legacy platforms like Choice Advantage** with features they should’ve had years ago — seamless integrations, reconciliation tools, UI improvements, and smart automations that actually save people time.

I focus on **end-to-end development**: frontend, backend, browser automation, data handling, and system design — all working together to create smooth, reliable tools that people love using.
